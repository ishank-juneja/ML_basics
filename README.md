# Machine Learning Assignments 
A repository for assignments done during the course CS 419 (Machine Learning) at IITB.

Assignment 1: Regression Trees 
An implmentation of a decision tree over a real valued data-set to create a model that predicts a real valued label.

Assignment 2: Loss-regularization framework binary classifiers
Implemented with L2 and L4 regularisers to prevent overfitting.

Assignment 3: Feed-forward Neural Networks with TensorFlow
Computational Graph models for implementing Neural Network based classifiers on Image (MNIST Characters) and Audio files.
